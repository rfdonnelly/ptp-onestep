= PTP One-step Hardware Timestamping
:imagesdir: images

This repository explorers PTP one-step hardware timestamping.

== Scenarios

Two scenarios are provided:

* link:ptp4l/README.adoc[ptp4l] - Performs one-step timestamping using ptp4l
* link:c/README.adoc[c] - Performs one-step timestamping using C code

== Topology

A point to point link between two systems is used for both scenarios.

== Example

The packet capture on the left shows that the timeTransmitter sent a zeroed timestamp to it's NIC while the packet capture on the right shows that the timeReceiver received a non-zero timestamp from its NIC.
